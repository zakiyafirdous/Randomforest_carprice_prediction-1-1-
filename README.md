# Randomforest_carprice_prediction-1-1-
In this project, I build a Random Forest regression model to predict car prices based on various features such as selling price, model, year, fuel type, Kms driven and other relevant attributes. Perform necessary data cleaning and preprocessing, and utilize the Random Forest algorithm to improve prediction accuracy through ensemble learning. The project culminates in an evaluation of the model's performance.
Skills:
•	Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data formats.
•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data distributions and relationships using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
•	Feature Engineering: Creating relevant features and transforming existing ones to enhance model performance.
•	Data Visualization: Presenting results through visualizations to effectively communicate insights.
•	Programming: Proficiency in Python and familiarity with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.
